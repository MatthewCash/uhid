# Soft WebAuthn/FIDO/U2F token

See https://github.com/psanford/tpm-fido for a full example. That project uses uhid plus a TPM to provide
a platform authenticator for Linux systems.

That project also includes a non-TPM mode with the flag `--backend memory` if you want to play around with
a uhid software based FIDO token.
